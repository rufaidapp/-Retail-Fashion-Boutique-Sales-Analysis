ðŸ‘—# Retail-Fashion-Boutique-Sales-Analysis
This project performs an in-depth data analysis of the Retail Fashion Boutique Data Sales Analytics 2025 dataset using WPS Spreadsheet. The goal was to uncover key sales trends, evaluate product and brand performance, and identify customer behavior patterns to provide actionable business insights.
The analysis is based on a synthetic dataset representing real-world fashion retail operations, including sales transactions, product details, customer feedback, and return data.
## Key Objectives
Analyze Sales Performance: Identify and visualize key trends in sales over different time periods.
Evaluate Product and Brand Performance: Determine the top-selling brands and product categories.
Understand Customer Behavior: Explore the relationship between customer feedback and sales.
Investigate Return Trends: Analyze return rates and patterns to understand potential product or process issues.
Present Findings: Create a clear, comprehensive dashboard to summarize all key insights.

## Methodology
The analysis was conducted entirely within a WPS Spreadsheet, leveraging its built-in features:
Data Cleaning & Preparation: The raw dataset was loaded into WPS. Data validation, formatting, and handling of inconsistencies were performed to ensure accuracy.
Pivot Tables: Extensive use of Pivot Tables was made to summarize, aggregate, and analyze data across various dimensions (e.g., Sales by Month, Sales by Brand, Returns by Reason).
Charts & Visualizations: Charts and graphs were created directly from the Pivot Tables to visualize trends, comparisons, and distributions.
Dashboard Creation: A final, interactive dashboard was created to present all the key findings in a single view, utilizing slicers to allow for easy filtering of the data.

## Key Findings
Here are some of the main insights discovered during the analysis:
Top Performers:  Brand 'Gap' consistently outperformed competitors, while the 'H&M' category generated the highest overall revenue.
Sales Trends:  "The boutique experienced its highest sales volume during the fourth quarter, driven primarily by holiday shopping.
Customer Insights: There is a strong correlation between high sales amounts and positive customer feedback. Sales with negative feedback were significantly lower on average.
Return Analytics: The top reasons for returns were identified as 'incorrect size' and 'product damage', highlighting potential issues in product descriptions or quality control.
Promotional Effectiveness: Promotional discounts had a significant positive impact on sales volume, particularly for certain product categories.
